You drop yourself by the dorm. The mere sight of your bed makes you wish you could take a nap.
However, there's a town to scare, and very little time to rest!
What are you gonna do here?
-> Go back to the corridor
    <<jump CorridorScript>>
-> Talk with Phoebe
Casey: "Hey Pheebs"
Phoebe: "Oh, there you are! Look at this!!"
